## About the Project

This project showcases a lightweight and accessible implementation of the Transformer architecture—the foundation for modern NLP and sequence modeling—entirely in JavaScript and HTML. With an interactive demo, users can explore and visualize the Transformer's operations, review predictions, and tweak model parameters in real time.

### Built With
- **HTML**: For the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For the implementation of Transformer operations.

## Features

- In-browser, interactive visualization of Transformer model predictions.
- Adjustable model hyperparameters (embedding size, blocks, heads, FFN size, etc.).
- Lightweight and browser-friendly—no dependencies required.
- Straightforward, commented codebase for easy learning and modification.
